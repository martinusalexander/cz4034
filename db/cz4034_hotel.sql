I think most of us are aware about the late check out procedures but I only needed him to put the request up so that the next staff that serves me would know I had requested for late check out in advance. We were then sent to our room, but Realized they had given us the wrong room. Because of theconfusing info on agoda(pictures with the living area,which the couple suite does not have)I thought I had paid for the family suite, but was given the Couple suite . Luckily, the family suite was available and they shifted us up. I requested extra pillows and towels, it took forever to send. and the reception was forever not picking up.

However, my partner and I were sneezing during our stay as the place was a little dusty.

I was very excited when booking this hotel again in Feb 2017. \n\nBefore booking my stay, I contacted the hotel reservation desk to make sure I could get an early check-in since I knew my flight from Melbourne - Singapore was arriving early. The email received was the generic response which you get from all hotels: It will depend on availability but we will endeavor checking you into your room as soon as possible. I was happy with the response since this is how hotels operate and you cant blame them for that. \n\nI arrived at the hotel at around 8am, tired after a long flight. The staff at the counter was very cold, couldnt check me in early, I was told to come back around 10am and advised that I could sit in the lounge and wait. I asked for a bottle of water and if there was a shower I could use to freshen up, she replied in a very rude way: Go to the swimming pool upstairs and ask for the staff, he will show you. Left my luggage at the reception and went to the swimming pool.\n\nI asked for a towel and the location of the shower to the pool staff, he didnt even reply, just pointed to the towel rack and when I asked for the shower again, he just pointed with his finger while sending a txt msg using his mobile phone. \n\nI tried to relax until 10am and went back to the check-in counter. Another staff then advised that my room wasnt ready and to come back at 12pm. Came back at 12pm after a short walk on Orchard road. There was another staff at the counter, I was advised that check-in was at 2pm. The other staff didnt even pass the message to his colleague. I waited in the lounge, exhausted and very irritated. After an hour (1pm) I went back to the reception,there was a big line of people, another staff was then letting other guest check in early.

The bathroom had a large tub, as well as a rainshower stall with a separate WC.Toiletries were from ESPA.Instead of a private pool, you had to share a common free-form swimming lagoon with the other villas.Each villa had its own outdoor jacuzzi although it is NOT private as the patio and jacuzzi are open to view from your neighbours. Moreover, the beach villa is a misnomer as there is no beach.The ESPA spa and gym were NOT open during my stay (this point was sadly NOT mentioned by RSW).Breakfast was at the Forest restaurant over at the Equarius.The buffet spread was mediocre but they did offer you the option of ala carte orders.

A little inconvenient but at least they are strict in the check-in policy which at least makes me feel safer on security standard.. They are however kind enough to release the room to us but still expect me to provide a softcopy of my identitification card within 12 hrs. While I was pondering (with a sunken face) on how should i get it done as Sentosa is very far away from my house, Sophia noticed my expression and out of concern, asked me whether I am okay and do I need any help. She seemed apologetic to my situation but they still stand by their policy.. Not complaining but giving them the thumbs up for attentiveness to guest and being strict on policy which i hardly see in other hotels. Fortunately i managed to find a softcopy and cleared the check-in fast. However, our room was not ready (even at check-in time) and we were ushered to The Library to enjoy their lounge with snacks and drinks. We waited for almost 2 hours before we were told that our apartment is ready. Not very happy with the wait as I would expect it to be ready by check-in time, and we got bored with the minimal snack selections that didnt get top up fast enough.\n\nThe staff serving us has been very friendly and drove us to our apartment even though it was a 2-3 mins walk from the lobby. Upon arrival then the staff told us that they have upgraded our room from a 1-bedroom apartment to a 3-bedroom apartment apartment!

The rooms looks great, it is what it looks online. The rest though is sadly disappointing.\n\nThe staff at the main hotel is disappointing. Ive checked with the staff during the check-in as I have requested also in agoda, if we can get a direct access to pool, the staff at the reception said it was just a short walk and not directly beside the room. Unfortunately, the short distance is not short. Its the other side of the hotel area. If youve seen the place, youll know its not a short walk. The staff could have honestly told us the room is not close and the walk is not short. I would rather have the honest answer than please us.\n\nWe also had a delay in the check-in, looking at people who later came getting checked-in on time. Im not sure is it due to lack of people to clean-up and ready the room after a check-out. Once we were at our room door, the welcome is great from the staff who were directing us to our room but shortly disrupted by another staff still inside the room making sure the complimentary tea/drink and the room are OK. I think they are short in staff and too many rooms to ready.\n\nWe also had a surprise visit from one of the staff. He knocked on our door, I had a hard time understanding what he was saying but based on his hand actions, I understood he left something in the room and wanted to check if it was there. \n\nAnyway, I let him look for a second to check if they left something. And no there was no object left by the staff. I expected a call from the desk for an explanation on why their staff is randomly knocking on our door. \n\nI am just sorry I didnt get his name to inform the desk of what had happened. It shows a lack of training or protocol from the staff.

What we didnt expect though, was to be rudely awoken at 4:30 am in the morning. 4 freaking AM!!!! An announcement was made by an automated system stating that a fire alarm was triggered and that we were to wait for further instructions. You could imagine that hearing this automated recording blasted into your room(from the speaker above our bed) at 4:30am wouldnt have been pleasant at all. I went out to the corridor, bewildered and unsure of what to do. I saw many other sheepish faces looking out of room doors too. It finally stopped 5 full minutes later with an automated announcement that it was a false alarm. We went back to bed and checked out the next day, expecting the front of desk staff to at least apologise or explain what happened the night before. Nope. Not a single apology or explanation until I asked. Is that really acceptable?? How can a hotel even ignore something like that? I wasnt even expecting some form of compensation, just a simple apology would have been enough! It was only after a few angry exchanges with the hotel management via email that they offered a free upgrade in room if I ever decided to stay in M Social again. Thanks, but no thanks!

However within 5 minutes thereafter I obtained 2 rooms in the same Shangri-La Singapore location through Agoda without any problems whatsoever. Thus it seems Shangri-La might be practicing a policy of price-gouging and disregarding their loyal guests for additional room rates. Although the room provided was very good, in their Valley Wing (which is their superior wing/product), the shower was not very effective (warm water would come from the hand-held shower whilst cold water dripped onto your head from their overhead shower simultaneously), their in-room coffee machine was not working, and their air-conditioning was too warm (even when set at 19 deg Celsius with fan on high). I informed the housekeeping representative about these and she promised to make a report and rectify the same but no action was taken during my 3 days stay. Their staff at the Valley Wing breakfast and tea lounges had no clue what Assam tea meant, although their menu stated that Assam tea was available. I was advised that they needed 24 hours advance notice to order Assam tea as it takes 24 hours to prepare the same?? I asked them whether they had a tea plantation, and a tea processing plant, in their garden or whether they would fly in some fresh tea all the way from Assam, India within the 24 hours? But this was just way over their heads. Other than these points, their general staff and service were very good.

The room is beautiful, clean and even though it has a private jacuzzi and daybed outside in the balcony, the set up is designed in a way that it is private yet not covered. The view is breathtaking and service provided by all the attentive and well trained staff was beyond my expectations.\n\nHowever, I think some maintenance can be improved to make it outstanding.\n\n1. The connection of the TV was not very good so most channels produced a streaky image.\n2. 3 buttons on the jacuzzi were faulty so the full experience could not be enjoyed and 1 component from the jacuzzi fell apart shortly after turning it on.\n3. The wireless telephone was always out of battery and would turn off in the midst of a phone call despite being left on the charging dock.\n4. Room service for breakfast was a little disappointing. The egg benedict was tasteless and my hot cappuccino which I requested to come with soy milk, had lumpy and curdled residue towards the end of the drink. Food portion was also rather small.\n\nOverall, my stay with Capella was exceptional and it is indeed one of, if not, the best hotel in Singapore. The location, quality of service and its ability to transport you away from the bustle and stress of Singapore, is worth a visit.',9.2,'2016-11-05','2017-03-30 08:02:03.838439','2017-03-30 08:02:03.838478',49,NULL),(4303,'Great sea view','Loved how the rooms were set-up and gave a birds eye view of the sea and surrounding trees, as if ours is the only rooom in the forest',9.2,'2016-11-05','2017-03-30 08:02:03.844007','2017-03-30 08:02:03.844034',49,NULL),(4304,'A pleasant stay','A very cosy enviroment',8,'2016-10-28','2017-03-30 08:02:03.857117','2017-03-30 08:02:03.857172',49,NULL),(4305,'Slightly disappointed but still a pleasant stay.

They nicely replaced my magazine that Ive used as mouse pad with a proper one. Something that never occur to me at all.

Ensuring that my table is neat and comfortable to work with.When checking out, their bellboy checked if we require a cab when retrieving our luggage from our room. We didnt follow him to lobby immediately but I think they take make effort to check and once were done with check out, our bags are already in the car boot. So we just need to ensure that the bags are all there in the boot and jump into the cab. All these are done without being asked.Its really good that we dont have to keep giving instructions or prompt anyone to do so.

The shopping mall has many varieties for sports and men clothes. Ikeas restaurant has reasonsble and acceptable foods..There are free bus shuttles to MRT in CBD.

Breakfast is included in the room price, however if you go there after 9am, you will be RUSHED, they have a quick turn over time for lunch set up, every morning when we got to the breakfast, most of the staff are moody, not willing to make any more food for you, even juice, its really not so nice to start your day with loads of quick quick attitude around. Hope the hotel will work out a better set up for breakfast!!

We took the lift up to the 16th/ 17th/ 18th floor (cant quite remember) and the moment the lift door opened, we barely stepped out of the lift and a staff said rudely, What are you all doing here?. We were speechless as we were obviously going back to our room, why else would we be there? We were relatively well dressed by the way, not like we were sloppily dressed. There appeared to be some VIP at that level as the staff seemed to be clearing food trays and there was extra security there. We were unhappy so we called the reception to feedback. At the end of the call, we were told that a service manager (or some relevant staff) would come and speak to us, but no one came, probably because it was almost 11pm.

My boyfriend even tried to scrub the stain himself and it actually got lighter. This just disappointed me as I feel like the hotel just wants me to bear all the costs instead of trying harder to clean. In the end the hotel waived the cost of the bathtub because i told them there were yellow stains in the bathtub when i checked in the room. I didnt complain about it because i didnt want to ruin my birthday mood with this issue. Can you imagine you might see some yellow stains on the center of the bathtub when you just enter the room and happily go check out the bathroom? I understand the fact that my purple hair stained the towels and it is hard to wash off. But I do hope that the hotel staff can be nicer when deal with this kind of issue and at least try to clean the stains. I believe some light stains on the towels can actually be washed off as my mum does it at home. I think the house keeping department should be able to do better than that. I didt mean to dirty the towels but it is really hard for me to control it as i cannot bring a towel to cover my hair wherever i go and when i sleep at night its inevitable that my hair will touch the pillowcase.

My review will be done as a comparison between the two.\n\nYou step into an immediately wider walkway in Mercures loft, neatly arranged amenities, tall windows which let in ample light, and high ceiling as you would expect of a loft layout. Everything was in a tidy and organised manner, and the sofa rolls out into a bed to laze about on the lower level. The shower and potty are located next to each other while the basin is opposite them.\n\nMoving upstairs, the bed was nice and soft that your body would sink into, with comfortable fluffy pillows to get a good nights sleep, there is another TV upstairs as well. Reading lights are installed should you be one of those needing an escape by delving into a good book before a nights rest.\n\nOverall, Id say that it is a value for money stay, considering that everything is brand new, smells fresh and the location is good for foods, shopping or even travelling into town(Bugis MRT is 1 stop from City Hall to drop off and transit to Orchard).

While staff escorted us to our room it was also mentioned that the rooftop bar was also booked for a private function and was also off limits to Guests. So we had no where to relax as we had planned because as a Guest we where less important than the two seperate private functions which meant that there was loud music from the lobby and the rooftop bar vibrating through our room. A Guest who did not hold back with his complaint was ushered out on to the street so as not to make a scene!!! We overheard staff tell the very irate Guest that the music would stop at 12 midnight. We went to a fabulous bar along the street called Tess. Nice food, drinks and cool atmosphere but expensive off course. We planned to go to the rooftop bar after midnight as did 2 other seperate guests. Guess what? Yes you guessed it we were met by a No Nonsense Bouncer who suggested we return back into the lift and get out of the rooftop private function which was still pumping. We had breakfast which was underwhelming and went touring for the day. We where promised at check out that our bags would be stored and that we where welcome to join the happy hour at the rooftop bar upon our return. We returned and was escorted to the rooftop bar to yes you guessed it, a whole bunch of people setting up another function.

As per to my knowledge, i arrived right on time to check in which is at 2pm. I requested for a smoking room. they advise me that the room wasnt ready and i had to wait for an hour. I proceed with the rest of the checkin procedure before heading out for lunch. An hour later i came back only to find out the room wasnt ready. The lady who was serving me said, it would only be ready in another 20 minutes. Frustrated, i waited at the lobby. I came back 20 minutes later only to find out that the room still wasnt ready. Another lady told me that it would only be ready in the next 45 mins. At this point, it was 2 hours over my check in time and i dont think it was fair for them to keep giving me empty promises, what kind of a 5 star hotel gives out empty promises? As me and my partner is already tired, we decided to just take the non smoking room and promised us complimentry breakfast for two. The next day, i went down with my partner to redeemed our complimentry breakfast. Halfway through breakfast, the bill was send to us. Apparently the system was not being updated that i was given complimentry breakfast.At this point, i questioned myself, where is the sincerity from hyatt? If this is a five star hotel, are they lacking in their system? During checkout, a vietnamese girl was serving me, she cant even speak proper english and i barely understand what she was saying. She accidentally mixed up my checkout paperwork with the guy standing next to me. I was not happy with my stay at Hyatt. Very Disappointed. Hope to hear from you guys soon. Thanks!

Waited for an hour for the room in the cafe with welcome drink served. Already noted that the Room was small during booking so no glum about it. Wi-Fi was not strong in the room. Always get disconnected when checking emails. The bed in the rooms can be adjusted/raise to the preferred angle when sitting/ lying down. But once you adjusted to you desired sitting posture, you will see the DIRT and Hairs under the bed !! This was the worst part of the stay especially when the Housekeeping has just spend about an Hour doing up the room, this was not acceptable. I was too tired to raise this concern during my stay as they have already mentioned that the hotel was full, so no point asking for a change of room.\n\n ',8,'2014-11-16','2017-03-30 08:02:27.987244','2017-03-30 08:02:27.987273',82,NULL),(7271,'Small is more','Service was great..

After fumbling around to pack all our belongings in complete darkness and having the staff come back to hurry us, we were tired and perspiring in the stuffy room. The staff gave us the keys to our new room which was located on a separate floor and not anywhere near the lift lobby. No one offered to help us with our bags and belongings (which obviously wasnt well-packed given the circumstances).\n\nAt 5am, tired and extremely disappointed, we finally settled into our new room.

The tap in my room leaked badly and we had to get extra towels to soak below the sink as we almost fell in the bathroom. Also, the room was dirty with stains on the carpet below the extra beds. Lastly, the room service was very rude as they hung up on me when I asked them to remove the extra beds. They were supposed to remove them 45mins ago.My first but possibly last experience.

It costs us less than $10 by taxis to all tourist spots (Sentosa -$12, Indiatown $9, Garden on the Bay $8, from/to the airport $22) - I only take a few trips by MRT due to my parents age and limited walking. The room itself is very clean and cosy, good size. Over the top of these, we are very impressed with staff friendliness especially the receptionist - Tram. On our first night there, my parents don’t feel very well due to long distance flight (8hours from Australia), and they want nothing except congee but they do not want to leave the hotel as the same time (they both 75+ and dad can hear only 1 side) so Tram guided us to the nearby places for congee, she even gave us a lift there as we still not familiar with the place.On 2nd night, our parents only want veggie noodle, and the 3rd night they only want fried rice (don’t want to go out for dinnerselective on food) so Tram helped us again, where to find specific food for them. Without Tram kind help, support, and patience, I would say my holidays would totally be ruined with all emotional. We stayed 4 nights in this hotel and very happy with its location, cleanliness, and awesome services, strongly recommended this place. (If you do not want oily food we would recommend good restaurant nearby would be Legendary Bak Kut Teh at South Bridge Road - only 2min walking, or veggierice noddle soup in Yong Tofu next to the nearby foodcourt, there are two 7Eleven next door.

As I understand it, this is the owners first hotel. I met one of them over afternoon tea and - quite apart from being very friendly - she was clearly passionate about their project and discussing small changes they were already making now theyd been open six months. The look is vivid and dramatic, a lot of gold and red, and I liked it a lot. For me the stand out thing was the service, all of the staff, but especially front of house (check in and the door man) were so so friendly and helpful, it really made the stay. The hotel is in Little India, an interesting and authentic neighbourhood. It felt like the owners were shooting for a salon type vibe in the restaurant/bar area (they mentioned they can turn all the chairs round to have film screenings for example) but it was always very quiet while I was there, which was a shame. I hope they manage to attract a crowd as they deserve to. My only quibble, and the reason I have given it 4 instead of 5 stars, is the room size. The room itself was very pretty, very nicely equipped, comfortable bed and nice linen. All the things youd expect of an upscale boutique hotel.

But staff greeted me at the curb and gave me a guided tour of the temple and explained its history before taking me into the actual hotel proper. I can only say awesome. To build a modern hotel around the remains of a historic building without damaging the actual building or making the temple less than it is, is a spectacular achievement of modern architecture, and many other tourism locations around the world should learn from their example.

When we insisted that we experienced what we did they explained that a worker from the next room did not know our room was occupied and sought to exit via the room we were in.Does this make any sense???This event was preceded by a number of phone calls to our room. When we answered several no one was on the line. When we answered the last time, there were already 2 people conversing and looking for someone. Raffles staff explained this saying that the phone had been hooked to the one next door when the 2 rooms had been rented as a suite. In each case (the break inthe phone calls) they apologized, nothing more. I think they should not have presented us with a bill after such a sleepless night and harrowing experience.

This was very strange as never once did we book a hotel here (mostly through agoda) that we had to give a deposit. Reception staff informed us that it would be better to give the deposit in cash as we can just receive this cash back upon check out (which we did), as opposed to giving a credit card as it would take several weeks to receive the deposit back from the credit card. So please take note.While waiting for the necessary paper work to be completed, which is a few mins, hotel staff did ask us to have a seat first, which is nice.\n\nHotel lobby had a vintage and peranakan feel to it, in line with the heritage name of this hotel.

The rooms are small, however as do most rooms in similarly ranged hotels. Rooms are carpeted, and makes the room very cosy. The bed is very comfortable, though the sheets are slightly of warmer material. Bed comes with a total of 4 pillows, which is really unexpected as most 3 star hotels here only come with the standard 2.

I booked this room cause I read about the rooms online, and I thought it would be a pleasant surprise to book a suite for our Anniversary for my Husband. The check-in process was quite fast, but I was expecting the receptionist to tell me more about the hotel and the facilities as it was my first trip there. But she did not. Only when I asked about the breakfast then she told me about the breakfast time and the place to go. She also did not mentioned much about the lounge that we can go to since I booked the suite. I also had to find out which level the swimming pool was. She also forgot to collect our security deposit and we need to come back down to settle it once we were checked in. The room was neat, but the cleanliness was lacking. As I had a 11 months old baby, she was crawling round the room. And she picked up chocolate pieces from the floor and there were some left on the office chair at the study table area! The chocolate pieces were also not very small, she could pick it up and nearly put into her mouth! Near the window, theres a curtain. And the ledge was also dusty. My girls dress had lots of dust as she sat around the ledge. But the room was really big and the amenities were as stated.I called to ask for a few things from house keeping, like towels, anti slip mat and a fruit knife. But the person on the phone wasnt really helpful. She just cut me off and said, knife not my department. But I thought she could assist by telling me which number to call? I also asked for a baby cot upon check in, but in the evening after I went out and return, the baby cot was still not there, and I got to call house keeping to ask for it again. However, on side note, it was thoughtful of the hotel to include a cake and a card for our Anniversary as I stated we were celebrating while booking. But the cake stated Happy Birthday though. But it was still a sweet gesture.

We had to contact reception as our jacuzzi was not working and we needed assistance. He assured us that the lights would only be visible at night under the moonlight. Fine. Later on, we realised that the LED lights were still not working and would not come on. Albeit it was late at night at about 10pm, he refused any attempt at trying to get the maintenance team to take a look although we were ready to use the tub. He confirmed that there was no way it could be fixed and that we would have to live with it even though it pretty much meant we were shortchanged of the full experience at Klapstar. \n\nWe later found out that this hotel which was previously known as Klapsons, was recently bought over by the Fragrance group. Having not been here prior, we unfortunately had no basis for comparison and werent sure if the service standards were affected with the recent takeover. \n\nUpon exiting our room, we found three big tubs/pails placed along the main hallway - these were used to collect rainwater from the ceiling.

They had put two single beds together and the two head rests. I realized I had to push one head rest to the side and put my arm in the gap in order to flick the night switch off - welcome to the twilight zone. There was a dodgy piece of torn a4 paper above the bed which is unreadable but assumed this was telling me to stick my hands behind the head rests and into the unknown.\n\nLock on my door stopped working at one point - the door was unable to close, lucky some random guy turned up with some WD 40 and got it working again. \n\nThe tv was not working in the room at first but this was least of my issues and was rectified by the nice staff. \n\nThe pool seems harmless enough - just make sure you put on your best swim suit as the pool is glass bottom style and people in the restaurant can look up as you swimming.

Throw in a free phone for your usage in Singapore that comes with 4G, free overseas calls and free WI-FI, I dont know what else we can ask for.\n\nGiven the price, I must say this is definitely a best value for money hotel.\n\n',10,'2016-12-27','2017-03-30 08:03:02.548430','2017-03-30 08:03:02.548458',131,NULL),(11384,'Conveniently located','Near to the beach, airportresidential area.

However, when i tried to sign for some tea of course the response was you do not have a card on file. This inconvenience was again repeated when room service was ordered for dinner and a card gizmo was necessary.The following morning, i could not find any creamer AND the nespresso machine had only sufficient capsules (3 nos) for 1 person when i had booked the room stating 2 persons and again upon check-in. When i tried the bar-fridge, it was locked.I made my way down to the front desk and explained my situation and had my card imprinted. With it, came the riddle of the bar-fridge. No card, no bar-fridge access. In the meanwhile, the complementary nespresso service has a little presentation box that sits 3 capsules on one side and 6 capsules if you flip it over. I flipped it to the 6 side hoping that this and the obvious presence a mans and womans clothing items would clearly indicate that there 2 people occupying the room ... Nope. The box was flipped back over and dutifully topped up for 1 person.Otherwise, the location is wonderful with a clear view of the harbour.

Also waited for their call to check in, they only called once when I missed their call, and didnt make a 2nd call until I call back. Anyway, its small matters.\n\nI also asked for special pillows since they have a pillow menu but the pillow never came. Called the concierge again, the line was busy.There was a few heavy knocks at the rooms door way past midnight when I was already falling asleep. Didnt get up to open so I was wondering if they could be sending the pillows at that time?! I called at 10+pm and it took so long to get back and way past sleeping time.

The location of the hotel is not quiet good and you need to walk 10 mins just to be on nearest metro station.Overall we enjoyed our stay and will be back here again on our next visit to Singapore.',8.8,'2017-02-19','2017-03-30 08:03:09.215589','2017-03-30 08:03:09.215615',139,NULL),(12094,'close to downtown','staffs are very kind and nice. location is very close to downtown. clean enough.',8.8,'2017-02-14','2017-03-30 08:03:09.220377','2017-03-30 08:03:09.220402',139,NULL),(12095,'clean and spacious room .recommended to stay','clean and spacious room .recommended to stay',8.8,'2017-02-13','2017-03-30 08:03:09.225435','2017-03-30 08:03:09.225460',139,NULL),(12096,'No comment','No comment',7.2,'2017-02-13','2017-03-30 08:03:09.230441','2017-03-30 08:03:09.230466',139,NULL),(12097,'nice hotel','recomended hotel to business traveller. good location and friendly staff.',7.2,'2017-02-12','2017-03-30 08:03:09.235474','2017-03-30 08:03:09.235500',139,NULL),(12098,'good location','good location, nice staff, clean and clear',7.2,'2017-02-12','2017-03-30 08:03:09.241512','2017-03-30 08:03:09.241538',139,NULL),(12099,'Good staff.. spacious room n clean','Thanks for upgrading the room',7.6,'2017-02-08','2017-03-30 08:03:09.246186','2017-03-30 08:03:09.246211',139,NULL),(12100,'Great place to stay','Hotel is clean, staff are friendly.

If no one was there or an empty room, do you think someone would open the door for you at 113am? And wouldnt it makes more sense to actually go to the reception and ask about the room? I opened the door and asked whats the issue? And then they just apologised. I called reception that never seems to pick up the call and finally did and promised to reprimand them. I doubt so.

Kam Leng is fine to store your things, has good wi-fi, and is generally OK if you are a solo traveller looking to save money and are not too picky about your accommodation. Thats all fine for me, but it feels like Kam Leng is in desperate need of renovations expecially in the bedrooms. The hotel is starting to show its age: the carpeting feel like its been ages since it was last deep vacuumed, the rust on the bathroom fittings is gross, and each room has a deep musky dank smell upon entering. Only after a few minutes of AC does the smell go away. Overall: an OK option if you are trying to cut costs, generally OK and clean, but I hope that the ownership spends some money to renovate and refurbish the rooms soon.

The staffs looked like theyre in a rush to check you in without a proper welcome or explanation about deposit, breakfast, or wifi availability etc.\n- Its unfortunate that breakfast is offered to all occupants, and not those who could afford it or opt to pay for it because it lacks quality and limited to an array of carbs servings \n- Theres no room service but food delivery is allowed. We opted for Uber Eats on our last night.\n- The Great Room; the hotel mini bar, not only have limited tapas/ snacks/ light food servings but it runs out pretty quickly.

How this hotel got a 7.7 rating is beyond me.Choose this hotel only if you cannot find another suitable room at the same price point.',4.8,'2016-08-03','2017-03-30 08:03:23.428272','2017-03-30 08:03:23.428298',157,NULL),(13822,'Clean, comfy, nice breakfast','The room is relatively small but comfy, breakfast was great.
