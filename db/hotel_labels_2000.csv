Besides that, age is showing within the interior and fixtures, e.g the curtain hook came loose on certain parts. It could be due to water saving measures, but the spray type faucet in the restroom sink is a little annoying since it splashes water all over. We tried to swim by the beach villa pools which was pretty unoccupied, however beware of invisible mozzie attacks by the lounge areas!! Definitely left us both with bad swellings! The management should try to fog the surrounding areas to ensure a more relaxing time as we couldnt even lounge longer than 10mins before getting bitten all over!

Had already Informed management but all they say is they improve next time only. They should have call or Ring the bell first. When I questioned them why come in, they just say see if need to TOP up anything at 7plus evening when no one requested. Which they can do so in the morning. 

After all this experience really teach me a lesson. Dont think thing for granted just becoz is a 6 star hotel. Maybe 4 star hotel is better than 6 star hotel

There was no shelter to go back to the hotel and there were no staff around the area. I made a call to resort world hotel line and asked if we could have a ride back by hotel buggy and they agreed to send. When the buggy arrived, the hotel staff says that it is for villa guest and drove off. Leaving us trapped at the shelter feeding the mosquitoes there. I was outraged and went to stopped the staff and asked him why not as the reception had agreed to send for the ride.

An breakfast charged was erroneously posted on my room charges and despite having clarified that it was a mistake and having repeatedly assured that my card would not be debited, I still received a displeasing surprise in the form of an unauthorised charge made without prior consent or knowledge. Subsequent attempts at communicating and resolving this issue amicably was hampered by an appalling lack of responsibility and lackadaisical demeanour from their customer service team. It was only after making a direct complaint to RWS resort wide feedback team, did I finally receive a call back (more than 24hrs later) from one of their duty managers who promptly proceeded to resolve this matter with commendable haste. Nonetheless, barring this incident, the overall experience was still outstanding. I do hope that the management team at hotel equarius will investigate and ensure that a repeat of such an unpleasant experience be prevented in the future. Cheers ",General

The fridge was dirty, the cupboard creaked and the door could have come off anytime. 

Theres no food place you can walk. Its just an isolated hotel. Sure its ok if you want to take a bus to Vivo or Chinatown, but thats a trip in itself.

We had an overnight on our way home and this hotel was three times the cost of anything else we stayed in including a previous trip to Singapore.I thought I would splurge since we had just one night. The window in the room was so dirty you could hardly see out of it it. The room was smallish and devoid of personality.The shuttle only goes every hour and a halfand it left five minutes early so we had to either wait an hour and a half or take a cab. We took a cab. We also had to take a cab the next morning or get up at 5:30 to get a shuttle that got us there 2 hours earlier than necessary. So factor that into your cost .If I was paying $40 a night I wouldnt be complaining. 
 The hotel is 10 minutes further from the airport then is advertised. However the location is very nice. Its near the ocean and theres a park and walking trails and a food court nearby.So if spending $100 + with no breakfast, and iffy shuttle is not a problem for you the location might make it worthwhile. Also they have a very nice pool.We werent there long enough to use it but it looked lovely.

We arrived for check in at 1am - concierge staff were very friendly and was a quick and easy check in - our paperwork was on the desk ready for our arrival. 

My mum had a fall in the rain up the road the next morning and we went to the desk for assistance - they were very attentive and brought ice and bag to make an ice pack to our room very quickly. 

The room itself is quite basic, but still has everything you need for a short stay - and this was more than I was expecting. Bathroom is spacious and clean, beds are SUPER comfy (more comfortable than the 5 star hotel we moved to for the rest of our 4 day trip!). It truly was the best sleep Ive had in a long time. 

Only downfall was the noise. We could hear the neighbours and people in the hallway more so than weve experienced in other hotels. 

Theres a fantastic hawker market open til 2am next door and another called Changi Village Hawker Centre across the road. It was great to be able to walk out at 1am and get dinner at that hour.

Location was far, and front counter staff was not exactly friendly. Nonetheless Im pretty easy going and did not kick up a fuss. The hotel room aircon is not very cold as well, and takes very long to cool down the room. At times we started perspiring in fact, and took a shower.

However, there was a little problem we only noticed after we reached our home. What i ordered and paid is for a Deluxe room with Sea View, but our room was facing the courtyard. So i dont really get what ive paid for.

Since we had a good time. Whatever.......

Decided to take up the Courtyard Suite as the highlight was a Private Jacuzzi Pool. However when we decide to go for a night swim with kids, the lights was faulty, thus it really dampen the mood, and we didnt really got thr chance to fully enjoy the room facilities at all.

Lastly, just when we wish to have a good night rest, the air-conditioner unit was unable to adjust its temperature. It was at 19 degree during the whole night, and we were shivering, waking up and never had a good rest.

Not the Amara service I was expecting.","Facilities & Services"
398,"Bad Experience","We arrived at the hotel lobby with no staff to help with unloading. me and my husband unloaded all the stuff ourselves. there were only two staff around at check in. The staff who attended to me, I only remembered him telling me, only tomorrow we will know if we can check out later than 12 noon. I think most of us are aware about the late check out procedures but I only needed him to put the request up so that the next staff that serves me would know I had requested for late check out in advance. We were then sent to our room, but Realized they had given us the wrong room. Because of theconfusing info on agoda(pictures with the living area,which the couple suite does not have)I thought I had paid for the family suite, but was given the Couple suite . Luckily, the family suite was available and they shifted us up. I requested extra pillows and towels, it took forever to send. and the reception was forever not picking up. Quite a disappointment with the standard and service of Amara.","Facilities & Services"
399,Disappointing,"Its sad that a place with such potential can be so disappointing.

My partner had pre-booked a cake with the staff beforehand to give me a surprise for my birthday. She specifically stipulated that this was not to be mentioned at check-in (so as not to ruin the surprise). Yet, at check-in, I was asked what time should the cake be brought in. Obviously, there was no more surprise. They offered late check out, which could only be confirmed later on in the day.

Birthdays/anniversaries and special dates only come along once in a while. If they cannot do this simple thing right, I think the quality of service (or lack thereof) speaks for itself. 

That aside, I appreciate the interior design of the Premier room, and the view and daybed by the window. However, my partner and I were sneezing during our stay as the place was a little dusty. Our noses were fine after checking out the following afternoon. 

I think this has great potential to be a sanctuary resort at such a prime location. But to the service staff and especially the management - you have your work cut out for you to achieve that.

Thedream pool looks like a beautiful place to relax and retreat to, hidden amidst lush greenery. There is also a sky pool, which overlooks the coast, and is more popular.

There is always kacang puteh, which are light snacks, and drinks at the lobby. The beach is 5 mins away, and there is a free bird show and kids play area there. 

Staff at Shutters were extremely helpful and friendly. Gave the children free juice and helped a lady who was fainting.A staff from housekeeping was very concerned when my child fell. He carried him and asked for ice immediately. Another staff also carried my child to the lobby.

They kept calling the room and disturbing my sleep to try and get us to give up the room when I already clearly told them I was going to pay for the extension. Eventually they persuaded us by saying well waive off the past few hours if we check out right now.And so we did, went to the front counter, and their staff DENIED making us the deal and wanted us to pay the $60 for 4 hours of extension.

492,"Not as good as expected","Last time I was at this hotel, it was around 15 years ago when traveling with my parents in my early teens. I was very excited when booking this hotel again in Feb 2017. 

Before booking my stay, I contacted the hotel reservation desk to make sure I could get an early check-in since I knew my flight from Melbourne - Singapore was arriving early. The email received was the generic response which you get from all hotels: It will depend on availability but we will endeavor checking you into your room as soon as possible. I was happy with the response since this is how hotels operate and you cant blame them for that. 

I arrived at the hotel at around 8am, tired after a long flight. The staff at the counter was very cold, couldnt check me in early, I was told to come back around 10am and advised that I could sit in the lounge and wait. I asked for a bottle of water and if there was a shower I could use to freshen up, she replied in a very rude way: Go to the swimming pool upstairs and ask for the staff, he will show you. Left my luggage at the reception and went to the swimming pool.

I asked for a towel and the location of the shower to the pool staff, he didnt even reply, just pointed to the towel rack and when I asked for the shower again, he just pointed with his finger while sending a txt msg using his mobile phone. 

I tried to relax until 10am and went back to the check-in counter. Another staff then advised that my room wasnt ready and to come back at 12pm. Came back at 12pm after a short walk on Orchard road. There was another staff at the counter, I was advised that check-in was at 2pm. The other staff didnt even pass the message to his colleague. I waited in the lounge, exhausted and very irritated. After an hour (1pm) I went back to the reception,there was a big line of people, another staff was then letting other guest check in early. By the time I was at the front another staff told me that check-in was 2pm. This time I cracked it, was furious and","Facilities & Services"

1. Breakfast is limited considering its cost. Replenishment is also limited and at certain times, no longer made despite the fact that breakfast time is still ongoing (supposed to ends at 10:30 am). Worst, they start cleaning the buffet table even if its not yet 10:30 which is disappointing to those having late breakfast. 
2. Just wondering why most cleaning staff, including the one in the breakfast restaurant, are cleaning so fast giving me the impression that they are in a hurry to go home. It makes me think whether the rooms were indeed cleaned well.

Did not extend courtesy to understand guests request and only regurgitated hotels position. 2) There were 2 staff at entrance and none offered to assist with luggage. 3) Paid more for Premier room but were old, while the cheaper Deluxe rooms were the renovated ones.4) Breakfast was not worth paying for, and it was the issue at check-in since the restaurant is not part of the hotel and there is a price difference in the room rate for single vs double occupancy. Unlike other hotels with their own FB outlets that do not have a price difference. 5) During checkout, had the bad timing of a fire alarm trigger that delayed the porter as the lifts were stopped for 40 minutes. 6) The only positive from the stay is the Manager who listened intently and took action to re-train the front desk staff.

After checking in, we were surprised to hear staffs talking thru PA system in our room. Although the staffs apologies after i called, saying they were experiencing error with their fire alarm system.

The buggy rides to and from the suites to other parts of RWS was swift and efficient. One surprise was that while we were in the room viewing the aquarium, there were 02 divers who waved at and surprised us! My wife was breastfeeding at that time but thankfully she was covered. We didnt consider that it might be a see through view into the room from the aquarium side. Also from the Aquarium side we could see the baby cot in our own room when we tried to see.

However the check in process started the whole experience with a bitter taste. There werent that many people checking in but the whole process took a long time. There were no separate check in process for villas and ocean suite. While waiting there was another guest who exploded because he had to wait so long to check in for his room. Feedback was given to the duty manager, Rachel who was not very responsive. However, Lionel, the butler manager, came on the last day of our stay and gave us reassurance that he will look into the matter and promised to make up for it in our next trip. It is staff like him that makes a difference.","Facilities & Services"

It is one-of-kind experience and you dont get this in your everyday hotel or villas stay. Furthermore it also has a second floor via a flight of steps leading up to a living room with a outdoor plunge pool to soak in. It is worth a try in Asia only underwater room though the price is steep for this kind of experience but at the end of the day it is still worth your every penny! Must try if you dont mind the ridiculous price though :-)!",Room
1076,"comfortable and quiet","We arrived quite late at the check in area and was expecting a good welcome service at equarius hotel checkin counter.
However what we got was just plain cold shoulder and there were 3 - 4 staffs atthe counter but nobody seem to notice us standing right in front. it felt extremely awkward. They looked more interested in having their own conversation and settling some issue than serve us. So I tried to look around for the Beach Villa check-in. There was one specially for beach villa guests check in, we are able to have a comfortable seat while processing the checkin. but as me and my hubby were about to sit down, this lady just told us. please check in on the other side. I got so shocked by their services, and i thoughti will never come back here again this is plain ridiculous. 
Luckily, after a very unhappy check in. The butler was quite nice getting us to the villa, and the villa was great. Nice and secluded area, good for chill out and stay cation for couples/ family.
We also had a jacuzzi pool to ourselves just in front the villa.
overall, for the villa itself, it was an amazing experience. They even allowed an extension of checkout! Although in the end we paid a good sum for check out at 6pm. It was too comfortable for us to leave ! (:","Facilities & Services"

View of the aquarium is awesome! 2 storey room. Ground floor is the bedroom. Top floor is the living room. Both floors have Jacuzzis but we preferred the ground floor one as we can set the temperature of the water and sit back watch the Marine life. We received a complimentary cake for our anniversary but it wasnt that delicious. 

Side note, please refrain from any private moments during aquarium opening hours as its just across the public aquarium display. Divers are able to see you clearly!

1122,"Idyllic beach villa but where is the beach?","I called up the Resorts World Sentosa hotline and was shocked when the Guest Reservations officer announced that all of their beach villas were fully booked till Dec 2012.Fortunately, I did not believe her and looked up Agoda.com where I secured a 1-bedroom villa for a night.The beach villas are located adjacent to the Equarius RSW hotel within the RSW complex.You drop off your bags and register at the Equarius check-in counter.Thereafter, you are escorted by buggy to your designated beach villa for an in-villa check in.My friendly butler was there waiting for me with a welcome drink, and check-in proceeded uneventfully.The 1-bedroom villa was of a semi-detached configuration, with another adjacent to it...it was NOT a fully detached villa enclosed within its own compound.The interior of the 1-bedroom villa consisted of a spacious bedroom, connected to a bathroom with an outdoor patio and jacuzzi.Regretfully, there was no separate sitting area. The bathroom had a large tub, as well as a rainshower stall with a separate WC.Toiletries were from ESPA.Instead of a private pool, you had to share a common free-form swimming lagoon with the other villas.Each villa had its own outdoor jacuzzi although it is NOT private as the patio and jacuzzi are open to view from your neighbours. Moreover, the beach villa is a misnomer as there is no beach.The ESPA spa and gym were NOT open during my stay (this point was sadly NOT mentioned by RSW).Breakfast was at the Forest restaurant over at the Equarius.The buffet spread was mediocre but they did offer you the option of ala carte orders. Service was excellent however.Strangely, I had a problem with millipedes in my villa bathroom.However, the service from my butler was stellar!It is also worthwhile to occasionally forgo the buggy ride to walk among the lushly landscaped grounds.","Facilities & Services"

1249,"A pleasant surprise","I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed my stay at the Peninsula Excelsior.Honestly the Agoda discount was the original reason I chose it, despite my friends telling me it wasnt a good location (I used to live in Sing).But they were wrong, its only two half blocks from the entrance to City Hall metro, and on the route of a number of busses.I had a corner room with a partial view towards the Singapore Flyerthe city from the other side.Although it was my first stay they put me on the 16th floor near the lift, which I appreciated as a female traveling solo.The room was adequate, and I loved the seat next to the window.I had health issues at the beginning and end of my trip, so had room service my first nightdinner With a friendat Coleman Cafe - both meals were delicious and reasonably priced.The cafe also serves all day breakfast.Downstairs is Spinelli Coffee, which I consider to be the best coffee in Sing.I did not go into Peninsula Plaza but it is located just across the street.Other tourist sites are nearby like The Peranakan Museum (walking distance), Chinatown (3 metro stations or a few bus stops away), Clarke Quay is technically in walking distance but not recommended in hot sun (I got dehydrated) etc etc.The hotel is not the most modern and could use an update.But it is not rundown as previously reviewed,just a little dated but still quite comfortable.Finally, the service is impeccable.It can be a little slow (it took over 1/2 for ice delivery sometimes) but really, thats typical in .Asia.The staff is friendly, efficient and helpful with a smile.All in all, it was a quite a lovely stay.P.S. They have recently started a hotel program called Elite Club.Its freerecommended if you plan return trips.The staff is not informed but if you insist like I did, they will contact you about the program.Its worth it.","Facilities & Services"

- Asked for 2 additional towels from housekeeping lady, she said she could not spare anymore towels as she didnt have enough, and only could give me ONE. I accommodated once but on the second time, it was the same reply. A big hotel with no spare towels is not acceptable. When i said I need 2 towels as the 1st time it didnt work, i had to share a wet towel with my daughter, she unwillingly gave the 2 towels looking very unhappy. 

- On the day i was checking out, I looked under the bed to check if my daughter dropped any toys under, and i found a used Mens underwear from previous guest. Obviously the 7 days i was staying there, Housekeeping did not vacuum or clean under the bed.

- Told reception and manager about it upon checking out, but there was no attempt /initiative to offer a feedback form. In the end I had to ask for it myself.

Its walking distance to both the famous Maxwell Food Centre - a mere 8 minute walk, and to Lau Pa Sat Festival Food Centre, a leisurely 15 to 20 minute walk. Chinatown a five minute distance from Maxwell. If unable to walk, theres also the Tanjong Pagar Food Centre, Tanjong Pagar Exchange and Tnajong Pagar Centre. The Conservation Area is also something else. Just dont expect similar pace to Orchard. This is a different experience.

Finally I could make them connect me with the tech guy. After few steps under his instruction, I was able to connect... all 6 devices, and he confirmed there is NO device limit as the other 3 said.

Check-in was a breeze, and the front desk staff was superb! I requested for a smoking room with one big bed. She found one which was on the Executive Wing and she upgraded me to it. I was so happy! In the room you are given a mobile phone which you can use around Singapore to make local calls, unlimited data, and unlimited overseas calls to select countries. Id say I was totally impressed. When my room was beginning to smell like smoke (for a smoker I dont want that though), the staff came to spray my room with room freshener. When I asked if he can leave it so I can spray on my own, he did leave it for me to use. DND is observed, and my bed was fixed every night. This is what I call excellent service. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my colleagues and friends. Thank you Carlton staff. Youre the best. ","Facilities & Services"

A little inconvenient but at least they are strict in the check-in policy which at least makes me feel safer on security standard.. They are however kind enough to release the room to us but still expect me to provide a softcopy of my identitification card within 12 hrs. While I was pondering (with a sunken face) on how should i get it done as Sentosa is very far away from my house, Sophia noticed my expression and out of concern, asked me whether I am okay and do I need any help. She seemed apologetic to my situation but they still stand by their policy.. Not complaining but giving them the thumbs up for attentiveness to guest and being strict on policy which i hardly see in other hotels. Fortunately i managed to find a softcopy and cleared the check-in fast. However, our room was not ready (even at check-in time) and we were ushered to The Library to enjoy their lounge with snacks and drinks. We waited for almost 2 hours before we were told that our apartment is ready. Not very happy with the wait as I would expect it to be ready by check-in time, and we got bored with the minimal snack selections that didnt get top up fast enough.

The staff serving us has been very friendly and drove us to our apartment even though it was a 2-3 mins walk from the lobby. Upon arrival then the staff told us that they have upgraded our room from a 1-bedroom apartment to a 3-bedroom apartment apartment!

Note also there is no lift to the unit, and youll need to go down a few flights of stairs from ground level. The unit is also some distance away from the lobby and we had to rely on the buggies to get to/from the lobby/carpark - this would be troublesome when it rains, as was the case for us.

1679,"Long wait for check-in","Hi,

We had a great time at the so SPA including their staff are great and the dinner buffet and breakfast buffet are excellent. The rooms looks great, it is what it looks online. The rest though is sadly disappointing.

The staff at the main hotel is disappointing. Ive checked with the staff during the check-in as I have requested also in agoda, if we can get a direct access to pool, the staff at the reception said it was just a short walk and not directly beside the room. Unfortunately, the short distance is not short. Its the other side of the hotel area. If youve seen the place, youll know its not a short walk. The staff could have honestly told us the room is not close and the walk is not short. I would rather have the honest answer than please us.

We also had a delay in the check-in, looking at people who later came getting checked-in on time. Im not sure is it due to lack of people to clean-up and ready the room after a check-out. Once we were at our room door, the welcome is great from the staff who were directing us to our room but shortly disrupted by another staff still inside the room making sure the complimentary tea/drink and the room are OK. I think they are short in staff and too many rooms to ready.

We also had a surprise visit from one of the staff. He knocked on our door, I had a hard time understanding what he was saying but based on his hand actions, I understood he left something in the room and wanted to check if it was there. 

Anyway, I let him look for a second to check if they left something. And no there was no object left by the staff. I expected a call from the desk for an explanation on why their staff is randomly knocking on our door. 

I am just sorry I didnt get his name to inform the desk of what had happened. It shows a lack of training or protocol from the staff. Im sure theres a better way to check if a staff left something in the room and not just randomly knock on doors.

The hotel bus driver( old man with blue spec) has the best service, please dont ask driver to wait cause he also have to serve other guest on the bus that need to rush too. if you are late just wait for another bus dont complain about the bus driver, is not fair to him.

The restaurant Italian restaurant offers very delicious food. Overall pricey but it is a 5star hotel. The only thing that is not 5star is the very poor housekeeping. Even if you ask for improvements it always takes at least 2 call and lots of waiting to get things clean up. For a 5 star hotel with corresponding prices the service must be improved a lot. No attention to the details at all! Overall, it is a nice hotel but the poor service experience is definitely a big negative.","Facilities & Services"
1707,"Disappointing stay","Booked a room for 3pax but toiletries provided was only for 2 pax. There was only 2 pathetic pieces of tissue left in the tissue box.

Called housekeeping to request for essential toiletries such as 1 more set of toothbrushtissue box but end up he came with towelsoap.

The only negative was its expensive Italian restaurant il Lido; the food was very average and the waiter couldnt even explain the menu (very little English - shocking for fine dining).

1730,"Poor Service","We stayed in Prestige Suite which had a weird layout. The lounge room and the bedroom is separated by the main door, we would have expected it to be more integrated, as shown in pics on the website. The mini bar was filled with items which made it tough for us to chill our own bottled water and the items in the mini bar are not complimentary. Given the status as a 5 star hotel, I was expecting the items would have been free. Also, we asked for 2 buckets of ice. 1 came, and the other one, we were told to pay SGD13. This is basically extortion. Luckily we drive, and we drove out and got the ice from 7-Eleven for $2.50 for a pack for 5kg ice. Not sure how much ice the hotel would have given us for SGD13. There were a lot of mosquitoes in the garden so we asked for mosquito coil. The front desk told us, I will check with the housekeeping if they still have it. Well, if you dont have it, then top up. Front desk told us that the hotel staff could go out and purchase mosquito repellent for us, and they will charge 5% on top of the purchase price for service. Seriously.. is it my problem you are located in such a deserted place and when I need something, I still have to pay you for getting it for me? In any case, we bought and left 1 box of mosquito patch for the hotel to keep for their future guests, or their staff.","Facilities & Services"

The rooms were really spacious. Some reviewers mentioned that they got an upgrade - I dont know if they got it free or not. Tried to ask but was told I had to pay about SGD50 more (so I guess it depends on what was the rate you paid). I honestly got a very good rate through Agoda promotion (otherwise wouldnt have been able to afford it). ",General

The room had a kitchenette and a laundry machine which is extremely comfortable when you are travelling with a little child.
A smart phone with the internet connection which is provided by the hotel was also a great help in our trips in Singapore.
The hotel is in the walking distance from ION plasa and MRT.

The only little drawback is that the suite rooms are in a separate building which is about 300m from the main building and do not have its own swimming pool.

I would definitely stay there again.",General

The Orchard MRT station is within 5 ~ 7 minutes walk, and there are many shopping malls, supermarkets, restaurants, and everything you might need around you. So, the location is very good.We stayed at the Parklane split-level studio. Its in a different building, and looks a bit more dated than the main hotel block. But it provides very spacious room - enough for 4 people or even more, it youre willing to pay for the extra bed. The split level studio is well equipped with kitchen and even washing machine, which is very helpful in the hot and humid weather of Singapore. The bathroom is also very clean and spacious. Some weaknesses are there, too. The building and the room itself are a bit dated. It needs renovation, but still, it is very well equipped, and it doesnt look cheesy. The room doesnt have a good view, either. Were on level 4, but I think other rooms will be the same. So, dont expect too much about its view. The staff are very nice and helpful. Id give five stars to them. The pools are nice, too. Dont forget to bring swimwear with you. You wont be disappointed.Overall, it was very satisfactory, and Id love to stay there again if I travel to Singapore with my family in the future.",General

We took his recommendation to dine at Gordons Grill we have never been so pampered by the staff at a restaurant. Krishna, Maria and the Chinese waitress (sorry I forgot your name) were very attentive. They took time to explain the menu and for the rest of the evening, ensured that you have your every need attended to. For dessert, the crepe suzette made by Maria (infront of our table) was a spectacular visual and gastronomical feast.

Cons - The cons are not really very bad just that we are a little picky on certain standards. 

1. The balcony is rather dirty because it is an open concept. Theres pigeons poopings all over. (Luckily Im not a balcony person)
2. The shower compartment is very small. It is already tight for an average size person. Cant imagine someone slightly chubbier inside. 
3. The shower door has side gaps where water will be spilled out during shower. Making the floor really wet. 
4. There is no disposable toothbrush. But we have sewing kits and cotton buds. Toothbrush is more of a necessity than cotton buds. 
5. TV channels are very limited. 
6. Ventilation in the room is not good when theres a kitchen for cooking. Ventilation should be taken care of.

Unfortunately staff elsewhere- front desk, housekeeping, gift shop, doormen were just not the same-- they were robots who could not have cared less or looking to rip off whoever might be a clueless tourist.

1999,Disappointed,"I am a Jade member of the Shangri-La Golden Circle and have been a fairly regular guest at their various hotels in India, China, Turkey, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand for which I am normally charged under a corporate rate. This time the Shangri-La rejected to provide me a room under the corporate rate and instead informed me that they were running a full house and thus could not provide me a room at all. However within 5 minutes thereafter I obtained 2 rooms in the same Shangri-La Singapore location through Agoda without any problems whatsoever. Thus it seems Shangri-La might be practicing a policy of price-gouging and disregarding their loyal guests for additional room rates. Although the room provided was very good, in their Valley Wing (which is their superior wing/product), the shower was not very effective (warm water would come from the hand-held shower whilst cold water dripped onto your head from their overhead shower simultaneously), their in-room coffee machine was not working, and their air-conditioning was too warm (even when set at 19 deg Celsius with fan on high). I informed the housekeeping representative about these and she promised to make a report and rectify the same but no action was taken during my 3 days stay. Their staff at the Valley Wing breakfast and tea lounges had no clue what Assam tea meant, although their menu stated that Assam tea was available. I was advised that they needed 24 hours advance notice to order Assam tea as it takes 24 hours to prepare the same?? I asked them whether they had a tea plantation, and a tea processing plant, in their garden or whether they would fly in some fresh tea all the way from Assam, India within the 24 hours? But this was just way over their heads. Other than these points, their general staff and service were very good. ",General
