Subsequent attempts at communicating and resolving this issue amicably was hampered by an appalling lack of responsibility and lackadaisical demeanour from their customer service team. It was only after making a direct complaint to RWS resort wide feedback team, did I finally receive a call back (more than 24hrs later) from one of their duty managers who promptly proceeded to resolve this matter with commendable haste. Nonetheless, barring this incident, the overall experience was still outstanding.

I think most of us are aware about the late check out procedures but I only needed him to put the request up so that the next staff that serves me would know I had requested for late check out in advance. We were then sent to our room, but Realized they had given us the wrong room. Because of theconfusing info on agoda(pictures with the living area,which the couple suite does not have)I thought I had paid for the family suite, but was given the Couple suite .

The bathroom had a large tub, as well as a rainshower stall with a separate WC.Toiletries were from ESPA.Instead of a private pool, you had to share a common free-form swimming lagoon with the other villas.Each villa had its own outdoor jacuzzi although it is NOT private as the patio and jacuzzi are open to view from your neighbours. Moreover, the beach villa is a misnomer as there is no beach.The ESPA spa and gym were NOT open during my stay (this point was sadly NOT mentioned by RSW).Breakfast was at the Forest restaurant over at the Equarius.The buffet spread was mediocre but they did offer you the option of ala carte orders.

Top it all, both our rooms were situated by the lift when I had already complained when the first one given was by the lift!! Horrifying!

In the room you are given a mobile phone which you can use around Singapore to make local calls, unlimited data, and unlimited overseas calls to select countries. Id say I was totally impressed. When my room was beginning to smell like smoke (for a smoker I dont want that though), the staff came to spray my room with room freshener. When I asked if he can leave it so I can spray on my own, he did leave it for me to use. DND is observed, and my bed was fixed every night. This is what I call excellent service.

A little inconvenient but at least they are strict in the check-in policy which at least makes me feel safer on security standard.. They are however kind enough to release the room to us but still expect me to provide a softcopy of my identitification card within 12 hrs. While I was pondering (with a sunken face) on how should i get it done as Sentosa is very far away from my house, Sophia noticed my expression and out of concern, asked me whether I am okay and do I need any help. She seemed apologetic to my situation but they still stand by their policy.. Not complaining but giving them the thumbs up for attentiveness to guest and being strict on policy which i hardly see in other hotels. Fortunately i managed to find a softcopy and cleared the check-in fast. However, our room was not ready (even at check-in time) and we were ushered to The Library to enjoy their lounge with snacks and drinks. We waited for almost 2 hours before we were told that our apartment is ready. Not very happy with the wait as I would expect it to be ready by check-in time, and we got bored with the minimal snack selections that didnt get top up fast enough.\n\nThe staff serving us has been very friendly and drove us to our apartment even though it was a 2-3 mins walk from the lobby. Upon arrival then the staff told us that they have upgraded our room from a 1-bedroom apartment to a 3-bedroom apartment apartment!

Note also there is no lift to the unit, and youll need to go down a few flights of stairs from ground level. The unit is also some distance away from the lobby and we had to rely on the buggies to get to/from the lobby/carpark - this would be troublesome when it rains, as was the case for us.

This time the Shangri-La rejected to provide me a room under the corporate rate and instead informed me that they were running a full house and thus could not provide me a room at all. However within 5 minutes thereafter I obtained 2 rooms in the same Shangri-La Singapore location through Agoda without any problems whatsoever. Thus it seems Shangri-La might be practicing a policy of price-gouging and disregarding their loyal guests for additional room rates. Although the room provided was very good, in their Valley Wing (which is their superior wing/product), the shower was not very effective (warm water would come from the hand-held shower whilst cold water dripped onto your head from their overhead shower simultaneously), their in-room coffee machine was not working, and their air-conditioning was too warm (even when set at 19 deg Celsius with fan on high). I informed the housekeeping representative about these and she promised to make a report and rectify the same but no action was taken during my 3 days stay. Their staff at the Valley Wing breakfast and tea lounges had no clue what Assam tea meant, although their menu stated that Assam tea was available. I was advised that they needed 24 hours advance notice to order Assam tea as it takes 24 hours to prepare the same?? I asked them whether they had a tea plantation, and a tea processing plant, in their garden or whether they would fly in some fresh tea all the way from Assam, India within the 24 hours? But this was just way over their heads. Other than these points, their general staff and service were very good.

An announcement was made by an automated system stating that a fire alarm was triggered and that we were to wait for further instructions. You could imagine that hearing this automated recording blasted into your room(from the speaker above our bed) at 4:30am wouldnt have been pleasant at all. I went out to the corridor, bewildered and unsure of what to do. I saw many other sheepish faces looking out of room doors too. It finally stopped 5 full minutes later with an automated announcement that it was a false alarm. We went back to bed and checked out the next day, expecting the front of desk staff to at least apologise or explain what happened the night before. Nope. Not a single apology or explanation until I asked. Is that really acceptable?? How can a hotel even ignore something like that? I wasnt even expecting some form of compensation, just a simple apology would have been enough!

Wifi is very strong which made me very happy. They provide a complimentary bottle of water and instant coffee. Bed and pillows are very comfortable. Rooms are made up everyday. Concierge staff are very friendly and helpful. They really made the effort to assist me with my needs.\n\nLocation is excellent. MRT station is right across the street. Chinatown is just a few steps away where there are cheap restaurants and where you can shop for cheap souvenir items. There are two McDonald restaurants, KFC, comvenience stores and malls nearby. \n\nMy only negative comment is I can hear guests when they talk on the corridor and also the noises from the bathroom of the room next to mine.

This happened to other car drivers at the noon time and caused massive jams. The car park attendance was very unhelpful and told us we have to borrow the cash card from other drivers. If we drive through the gate we have to pay. WIth this kind of advise, it shows that the parking company has no sense of courtesy to help foreign car and not fit to be in the position.

They nicely replaced my magazine that Ive used as mouse pad with a proper one. Something that never occur to me at all. Then when they noticed the cables on my table was everywhere, they tie my cables with a cable clip. Ensuring that my table is neat and comfortable to work with.When checking out, their bellboy checked if we require a cab when retrieving our luggage from our room. We didnt follow him to lobby immediately but I think they take make effort to check and once were done with check out, our bags are already in the car boot. So we just need to ensure that the bags are all there in the boot and jump into the cab. All these are done without being asked.Its really good that we dont have to keep giving instructions or prompt anyone to do so.

Through my agoda booking, I have clearly stated to have the BBQ area to be in front of the wagon.

She passed a document to sign without letting me vet through then told me there will be an additional charge of $30 for catering disposal, showing me in the document. I felt super dissatisfied with her service. She should have told me its a term and condition and allow me read through instead of rushing me to sign then told me about additional charges. Upon check in, the staff gave me a roomwhere the BBQ area was at the back. We were dissatisfied and went back for another room. We saw a room with a garden besides wagon even though the BBQ area is at the back of wagon. We asked if we could have that room. replied no as it was booked. We then argued that we stated in the booking for BBQ area to be in front. She then passed us the room key. If it was taken, why she could change the room as and when she wants? Besides this issue, there is a toilet choke from 3pm and it was left unsolved till 5am next morning.

The wireless telephone was always out of battery and would turn off in the midst of a phone call despite being left on the charging dock.\n4. Room service for breakfast was a little disappointing. The egg benedict was tasteless and my hot cappuccino which I requested to come with soy milk, had lumpy and curdled residue towards the end of the drink.

The spread of breakfast was very limited but still decent. Went for the all-day deandeluca refreshment at about 4pm on Saturday but to find out that theres only 4muffins and 2 scones left and a free flow soft-serve ice cream machine.

Lastly, I ordered room service for a simple aioli fries., which came lukewarm and soggy. That has to be worked on, quite simply.

The high-ceiling lobby is bright with natural sunlight and cheerful in the day, and sexily mysterious in the night thanks to glittery glass features.\n\nWe stayed in the executive king suite on the 14th floor and highly recommend this unit to guests desiring splendid views of the city and a spacious room to call home for a few days. We loved the floor-to-ceiling windows framed by a low wooden platform where we sat and read as the rain poured outside. We loved the deep soaking bath, from where we watched life go by below. We loved the large, comfortable bed that could easily rival other brands signature plush beds.\n\nFor our bellies, Lime restaurant on the ground floor is a delight. The lunch buffet we had featured an extensive line-up of local and international dishes. The local dishes were as authentic as what youd find in the family-run restaurants in the neighbourhood, which is a rare achievement for hotel restaurants. We loved the dry fried laksa, Hokkien prawn mee and rojak. And if you fancy durians, the durian pengat is to die for.\n\nPay more for Club Lounge access if you can. The space on the 16th floor is gorgeous all day long, and utterly romantic after sunset.

However, right from the start, I didnt feel that the service was top notch. Ive been to hotels which serve a welcome drink (even ice cold water would be better than nothing) and some even have towels for freshening up. However, what disappointed us was an incident that happened at night when we came back from our shopping. We took the lift up to the 16th/ 17th/ 18th floor (cant quite remember) and the moment the lift door opened, we barely stepped out of the lift and a staff said rudely, What are you all doing here?. We were speechless as we were obviously going back to our room, why else would we be there? We were relatively well dressed by the way, not like we were sloppily dressed. There appeared to be some VIP at that level as the staff seemed to be clearing food trays and there was extra security there. We were unhappy so we called the reception to feedback. At the end of the call, we were told that a service manager (or some relevant staff) would come and speak to us, but no one came, probably because it was almost 11pm. There wasnt any follow up even the next day.

So when we are back to hotel after dinner, we called the reception to request for shampoos and towel, we were told that the housekeeping service stops at 5pm. They can try to check if the store room is locked or not, and try to get us the shampoo and towels. No one reverted that they failed to attend the request. 3. We left some glasses which we used for yogurts and left in sink. When we come back, the glasses were washed but the yogurt stains still on them!\nIt is a true disappointment that they brand themselves as a luxury serviced apartment but service stops at 5pm.

My boyfriend even tried to scrub the stain himself and it actually got lighter. This just disappointed me as I feel like the hotel just wants me to bear all the costs instead of trying harder to clean. In the end the hotel waived the cost of the bathtub because i told them there were yellow stains in the bathtub when i checked in the room. I didnt complain about it because i didnt want to ruin my birthday mood with this issue. Can you imagine you might see some yellow stains on the center of the bathtub when you just enter the room and happily go check out the bathroom? I understand the fact that my purple hair stained the towels and it is hard to wash off. But I do hope that the hotel staff can be nicer when deal with this kind of issue and at least try to clean the stains. I believe some light stains on the towels can actually be washed off as my mum does it at home. I think the house keeping department should be able to do better than that. I didt mean to dirty the towels but it is really hard for me to control it as i cannot bring a towel to cover my hair wherever i go and when i sleep at night its inevitable that my hair will touch the pillowcase.

There is an ipad and iphone machine which can control many things in the room - smart room concept. Complimentary drinks and snacks at the in room bar which is good. Just besides lau pa sat.

I had booked the loft and was eager to compare it with another establishment which is popularly known for this set-up, and I am happy to report, I honestly preferred Mercures loft. My review will be done as a comparison between the two.\n\nYou step into an immediately wider walkway in Mercures loft, neatly arranged amenities, tall windows which let in ample light, and high ceiling as you would expect of a loft layout. Everything was in a tidy and organised manner, and the sofa rolls out into a bed to laze about on the lower level. The shower and potty are located next to each other while the basin is opposite them.\n\nMoving upstairs, the bed was nice and soft that your body would sink into, with comfortable fluffy pillows to get a good nights sleep, there is another TV upstairs as well. Reading lights are installed should you be one of those needing an escape by delving into a good book before a nights rest.\n\nOverall, Id say that it is a value for money stay, considering that everything is brand new, smells fresh and the location is good for foods, shopping or even travelling into town(Bugis MRT is 1 stop from City Hall to drop off and transit to Orchard).

There is a ton of food in the area and the hotel itself has some great options!\n\n\nThe Executive Lounge is very nice and well appointed/updated. Again, the staff was incredible and always outgoing. The selection for Breakfast and Evening snacks was very nice - they are definitely on improving their selection and paying attention to detail. \n\nThe pool is on the top of the hotel which gives it great sun when it is out as well as fairly spacious for a rooftop pool in Singapore. \n\nOverall the hotel is a great choice to stay if Orchard is the area you are looking to be in.

We fancied the black and white decor theme and that was precisely the reason we chose Naumi over another boutique hotel before booking. However, we were allotted a room with Woody theme which we didnt know it exists. There wasnt any mention of this theme on its Website. It was only then did the staff told us about having 2 themes for their Oasis rooms. The Woody theme didnt appeal to us though. The window was facing a dilapidated and mouldy wall of a shophouse and had no view to speak of. The decor was plain normal like any other non-boutique hotel. Hence we requested to change to the Black and White room but the staff said they have already committed those rooms to other Guests. We did not understand what the commitment was since there wasnt a choice of room decor during Booking. Since the other Guests have not checked in, why could she have allowed a room swap? Perhaps to get us off her back, she told us to return to our room while she checked with her Manager about the possible arrangements. However, we didnt hear from her nor her Manager since. We had to make do with the Woody room since we had to prepare and head out for dinner. It was utter disappointment!

While staff escorted us to our room it was also mentioned that the rooftop bar was also booked for a private function and was also off limits to Guests. So we had no where to relax as we had planned because as a Guest we where less important than the two seperate private functions which meant that there was loud music from the lobby and the rooftop bar vibrating through our room. A Guest who did not hold back with his complaint was ushered out on to the street so as not to make a scene!!! We overheard staff tell the very irate Guest that the music would stop at 12 midnight. We went to a fabulous bar along the street called Tess. Nice food, drinks and cool atmosphere but expensive off course. We planned to go to the rooftop bar after midnight as did 2 other seperate guests. Guess what? Yes you guessed it we were met by a No Nonsense Bouncer who suggested we return back into the lift and get out of the rooftop private function which was still pumping. We had breakfast which was underwhelming and went touring for the day. We where promised at check out that our bags would be stored and that we where welcome to join the happy hour at the rooftop bar upon our return.

As per to my knowledge, i arrived right on time to check in which is at 2pm. I requested for a smoking room. they advise me that the room wasnt ready and i had to wait for an hour. I proceed with the rest of the checkin procedure before heading out for lunch. An hour later i came back only to find out the room wasnt ready. The lady who was serving me said, it would only be ready in another 20 minutes. Frustrated, i waited at the lobby. I came back 20 minutes later only to find out that the room still wasnt ready. Another lady told me that it would only be ready in the next 45 mins. At this point, it was 2 hours over my check in time and i dont think it was fair for them to keep giving me empty promises, what kind of a 5 star hotel gives out empty promises? As me and my partner is already tired, we decided to just take the non smoking room and promised us complimentry breakfast for two. The next day, i went down with my partner to redeemed our complimentry breakfast. Halfway through breakfast, the bill was send to us. Apparently the system was not being updated that i was given complimentry breakfast.At this point, i questioned myself, where is the sincerity from hyatt? If this is a five star hotel, are they lacking in their system? During checkout, a vietnamese girl was serving me, she cant even speak proper english and i barely understand what she was saying. She accidentally mixed up my checkout paperwork with the guy standing next to me. I was not happy with my stay at Hyatt. Very Disappointed. Hope to hear from you guys soon. Thanks!

After fumbling around to pack all our belongings in complete darkness and having the staff come back to hurry us, we were tired and perspiring in the stuffy room. The staff gave us the keys to our new room which was located on a separate floor and not anywhere near the lift lobby.

However, it does make for a nice quiet weekend in the middle of the financial district!\nOur Collyer Suite was nice and large, and generally clean.It did look a bit spartan as there were no flowers to spruce up the room, so entering it lacked that warm welcome that it portrayed in the websites photos.I wonder if they dont extend that extra touch to customers making reservations from Agoda... \nThere was also a problem getting the wifi to work in our room, and due to a computer glitch, I had to log in using another room number and another guest name... It worked, but did feel odd. Also, the cable networks in the TV in the bedroom did not work, and the plugs behind the TV there were in a big mess, with the sockets actually coming off the wall.I hope they have that fixed.\nOverall, a good stay...

When I checked in late on 14 March, I was rejected for using debit card for the incidental charges even though I told the front desk that I have been using debit card for all my transactions in Singapore and the staycations and no one has ever rejected me.

I find this explanation unreasonable and senseless in the business context. And it is not that weekend; it is only 3 days ago (still within this week) that I had encountered this inconvenience.

Totally disappointed and I spoke to the reception but was then told that its by availability (which was totally not stated on agodas booking site). The tap in my room leaked badly and we had to get extra towels to soak below the sink as we almost fell in the bathroom. Also, the room was dirty with stains on the carpet below the extra beds. Lastly, the room service was very rude as they hung up on me when I asked them to remove the extra beds. They were supposed to remove them 45mins ago.My first but possibly last experience.

The room itself is very clean and cosy, good size. Over the top of these, we are very impressed with staff friendliness especially the receptionist - Tram. On our first night there, my parents don’t feel very well due to long distance flight (8hours from Australia), and they want nothing except congee but they do not want to leave the hotel as the same time (they both 75+ and dad can hear only 1 side) so Tram guided us to the nearby places for congee, she even gave us a lift there as we still not familiar with the place.On 2nd night, our parents only want veggie noodle, and the 3rd night they only want fried rice (don’t want to go out for dinnerselective on food) so Tram helped us again, where to find specific food for them. Without Tram kind help, support, and patience, I would say my holidays would totally be ruined with all emotional.

So even I had cards, we can do nothing on there but just watching and getting heat.\n\nThe most crucial thing that I encountered was that when I was on the pool level and I needed to go to the mens room, which was just downstairs. When I got there, I was heading to the mens room of course. And there was other guests behind me. And your staff obstructed me, and pointing the sign of ladys. I was in shocked and didnt want to answered him. I still headed to mens room again, and he stopped me again. And said man or women?. !!!This was absurd, impolite, offended and insulted, I could have called the police! What on earth the staff would ask someone or confused guests gender? It was really embarrassing me, there was other guests behind me as I mentioned. \n\nThis is so called a 5 star hotel?\n\nAnd I emailed customer service, I got an response by one of the manager. She said if I needed some wine like a compensation, but I dont drink alcohol, I said soft drinks would be just fine. And I said Ill be leaving at 6:30pm, but the staff delivered after the time that I told her. I was waiting again. Even if I went through the uncomfortable treatment by the staff.

The staff was friendly and he even enthusiastically gave me recommendation of cheap but delectable food approved by the locals.\n\nThe infinity pool is something not to be missed while staying in this hotel. The view was spectacular. The water was pleasantly cold. Clean towels were abundant even though the pool was packed with people. The trees provided just the right amount of shade from the scorching sun. Great place to unwind.\n\nOverall, I am greatly impressed with the service and facilities of this hotel. I love how special they make you feel during your stay.

The Shoppes is huge and has both upscale restaurants and a large food court that offers local food at local price. The only downside is that many of them open at 10am, not good if you are an early bird looking for breakfast. There are tonnes of places to take photos, like the Skypark observation deck and the Promenade which give a panoramic view of the best part of the city, and the Gardens by the Bay. I stayed at the Premier room which is probably the least expensive one and yet it has a breath-taking view with a spacious room and a large balcony.

As I understand it, this is the owners first hotel. I met one of them over afternoon tea and - quite apart from being very friendly - she was clearly passionate about their project and discussing small changes they were already making now theyd been open six months. The look is vivid and dramatic, a lot of gold and red, and I liked it a lot. For me the stand out thing was the service, all of the staff, but especially front of house (check in and the door man) were so so friendly and helpful, it really made the stay. The hotel is in Little India, an interesting and authentic neighbourhood. It felt like the owners were shooting for a salon type vibe in the restaurant/bar area (they mentioned they can turn all the chairs round to have film screenings for example) but it was always very quiet while I was there, which was a shame. I hope they manage to attract a crowd as they deserve to. My only quibble, and the reason I have given it 4 instead of 5 stars, is the room size. The room itself was very pretty, very nicely equipped, comfortable bed and nice linen. All the things youd expect of an upscale boutique hotel. But it was very small for the price - a little claustrophobic. Small enough to knock my legs more than once on the bureau handle as I moved past the bed.

Kudos to them for paying attention to such details.\n\nOne area to improve will be the location of the tv. It is mounted on a panel at the side of the bed.

Small pack of crisps and some nut.\nThe hotel doesnt have a restaurant, yet. You hardly notice. The hotel backs onto a street of bars and restaurants open at most hours of the day.

So espresso it was. 3 or 4 boutique teas there as well. Try the caramel one, its great.\nA TV on the wall with some cable channels, not enough in English. Free internet. Free map of the area.\nNice shower with two heads, wall and rain. Took a while for the shower to run hot. It will, you just have to wait for it.

The driver was very apologetic but after travelling all day I did wish hed been on time. The check in was a breeze. They really are about service. \nWould I stay again? absolutely!

The dinner ( I got the thai green curry) was yum and they also have a snack bar which has apples, toast, noodles and little cakes that you can help yourself to at any time. This meant I didnt end up needing to exchange any money on Singapore as I had my free dinner and some toast and an apple for breakfast. The room was small, the bed is probably about 190cms long so if you are tall it might not be as comfortable, but it was perfect for me. My only 2 negatives were the staff seemed a bit unprofessional at times and I sometimes felt uncomfortable asking them for something as they seemed very involved in their own conversations. The 2nd negative was that you could hear the doors slamming throughout the night as people came and went from their rooms but this was easily solved with earplugs. Overall The Haven was perfect for an overnight stopover and I would certainly stay there again then next time I pass through Singapore.

This was very strange as never once did we book a hotel here (mostly through agoda) that we had to give a deposit. Reception staff informed us that it would be better to give the deposit in cash as we can just receive this cash back upon check out (which we did), as opposed to giving a credit card as it would take several weeks to receive the deposit back from the credit card. So please take note.While waiting for the necessary paper work to be completed, which is a few mins, hotel staff did ask us to have a seat first, which is nice.\n\nHotel lobby had a vintage and peranakan feel to it, in line with the heritage name of this hotel.

The staff was unhelpful when asked about things like parking. Because hotel parking is limited, we had to use the roadside parking lots. When asked the staff about it, they quickly brushed us aside and suggested that if we park outside, its our problem. We only wanted to find out how to pay for parking. To be fair, one staff did eventually direct us to a nearby 7-11, but even he did not know how the parking system worked here.\n\nRooms were alright, but not suitable for young children because of a lot of sharp corners and edges.

I booked this room cause I read about the rooms online, and I thought it would be a pleasant surprise to book a suite for our Anniversary for my Husband. The check-in process was quite fast, but I was expecting the receptionist to tell me more about the hotel and the facilities as it was my first trip there. But she did not. Only when I asked about the breakfast then she told me about the breakfast time and the place to go. She also did not mentioned much about the lounge that we can go to since I booked the suite. I also had to find out which level the swimming pool was. She also forgot to collect our security deposit and we need to come back down to settle it once we were checked in. The room was neat, but the cleanliness was lacking. As I had a 11 months old baby, she was crawling round the room. And she picked up chocolate pieces from the floor and there were some left on the office chair at the study table area! The chocolate pieces were also not very small, she could pick it up and nearly put into her mouth! Near the window, theres a curtain. And the ledge was also dusty. My girls dress had lots of dust as she sat around the ledge. But the room was really big and the amenities were as stated.I called to ask for a few things from house keeping, like towels, anti slip mat and a fruit knife. But the person on the phone wasnt really helpful. She just cut me off and said, knife not my department. But I thought she could assist by telling me which number to call? I also asked for a baby cot upon check in, but in the evening after I went out and return, the baby cot was still not there, and I got to call house keeping to ask for it again. However, on side note, it was thoughtful of the hotel to include a cake and a card for our Anniversary as I stated we were celebrating while booking. But the cake stated Happy Birthday though. But it was still a sweet gesture.

I just get so frustrated with the front desk staff after a long drive into Singapore , like the other day there is a guest with his I Pad out and searching for directions with the reception helping him with sights to see ect ect , why could he have not been sent over to the corsage for help on site seeing instead of holding up guests wanting to get into their rooms and rest up ??Anyway on another point I am sure that the receptionist must have know my concern as I was upgraded to a better room , one more point and I guess nothing can be done about this but ITS a pain when you cannot park under the Hotel , especially when its Sunday and half of the East Coast is lunching at the Hotel Restaurants , maybe they should have to park in the upper car park ?',6,'2016-12-09','2017-03-30 13:02:56.319627','2017-04-07 08:16:25.894993',108,9395),(9396,'average three star hotel','just average three star hotel, with quiet neigbourhood and environment, laong distance walk is needed if you travel by MRT .. but just infront of bus stop if you travel by Bus',7.2,'2016-12-09','2017-03-30 13:02:56.324889','2017-04-07 08:16:25.902982',108,9396),(9397,'Good location cozy room','Pros: shuttle bus tofrom airport; close to marine parade; cozy room;friendly staff\nCons: hand sin blocked; air dryer too old; blanket too thin',8,'2016-12-08','2017-03-30 13:02:56.330818','2017-04-07 08:16:25.908932',108,9397),(9398,'Grand Mercure Roxy Singapore','Stayed a few times and dont mind staying again....',6,'2016-12-07','2017-03-30 13:02:56.336127','2017-04-07 08:16:25.914649',108,9398),(9399,'Friendly Staff','Clean rooms with acceptable size.',8,'2016-12-07','2017-03-30 13:02:56.342639','2017-04-07 08:16:25.920012',108,9399),(9400,'Great stay','Convenient, good service, clean',8.4,'2016-12-05','2017-03-30 13:02:56.348219','2017-04-07 08:16:25.930751',108,9400),(9401,'Great stay','Convenient, clean, good service',8.4,'2016-12-05','2017-03-30 13:02:56.354370','2017-04-07 08:16:25.944249',108,9401),(9402,'Great stay','Convenient, clean, good service',8.8,'2016-12-05','2017-03-30 13:02:56.360287','2017-04-07 08:16:25.957972',108,9402),(9403,'Nice stay','Convenient, great location, and good service',8.4,'2016-12-05','2017-03-30 13:02:56.366690','2017-04-07 08:16:25.971247',108,9403),(9404,'The room was big and spacious, bed is huge.

We had to contact reception as our jacuzzi was not working and we needed assistance. He assured us that the lights would only be visible at night under the moonlight. Fine. Later on, we realised that the LED lights were still not working and would not come on. Albeit it was late at night at about 10pm, he refused any attempt at trying to get the maintenance team to take a look although we were ready to use the tub. He confirmed that there was no way it could be fixed and that we would have to live with it even though it pretty much meant we were shortchanged of the full experience at Klapstar. \n\nWe later found out that this hotel which was previously known as Klapsons, was recently bought over by the Fragrance group. Having not been here prior, we unfortunately had no basis for comparison and werent sure if the service standards were affected with the recent takeover. \n\nUpon exiting our room, we found three big tubs/pails placed along the main hallway - these were used to collect rainwater from the ceiling. Seems like alot was broken about this place - needs alot of upgrading both in terms of aesthetics and service. \n\nMixed feelings about this place as it was value for money for its size, and the jacuzzi in the suite. Wouldnt return otherwise.

They had put two single beds together and the two head rests. I realized I had to push one head rest to the side and put my arm in the gap in order to flick the night switch off - welcome to the twilight zone. There was a dodgy piece of torn a4 paper above the bed which is unreadable but assumed this was telling me to stick my hands behind the head rests and into the unknown.\n\nLock on my door stopped working at one point - the door was unable to close, lucky some random guy turned up with some WD 40 and got it working again. \n\nThe tv was not working in the room at first but this was least of my issues and was rectified by the nice staff. \n\nThe pool seems harmless enough - just make sure you put on your best swim suit as the pool is glass bottom style and people in the restaurant can look up as you swimming. Im sure the intent was to make something unique but it just seemed a bit weird and a bit perverted. No skinny dipping please. \n\nThe location is a long walk to lavender mrt with maze like roads. Ask the staff for location help before you leave. Its hot out there and you will sweat after a few mins walking. \n\nBreakfast was Average but liked how they cooked it for you there and then so it was fresh.\n\nSuggest you have a decent breakfast on the same road at the many cafe places.

Instead of taking the initiative of changing another room for me, they actually expected me (the guest) to take this room again while waiting for the technician to do the servicing. I have to voice out for a change of room incase the leakage came back again. Only then, the reception said oh... you want to change to another room.. ok. However you have to bring the current key down to reception to exchange for the other rooms.\n\nFor the above, I think the first instinct should be initiate to change to another available room instead of holding up their time and for nothing.\n\n\n3.

It started with a swift check-in that was welcoming and an especially honored reception by the bellboy. But there was 1 element that was skipped and that was the otherwise usual imprinting of a credit card. I merely dismissed it thinking that there was a new crediting system in place. However, when i tried to sign for some tea of course the response was you do not have a card on file. This inconvenience was again repeated when room service was ordered for dinner and a card gizmo was necessary.The following morning, i could not find any creamer AND the nespresso machine had only sufficient capsules (3 nos) for 1 person when i had booked the room stating 2 persons and again upon check-in. When i tried the bar-fridge, it was locked.I made my way down to the front desk and explained my situation and had my card imprinted. With it, came the riddle of the bar-fridge. No card, no bar-fridge access. In the meanwhile, the complementary nespresso service has a little presentation box that sits 3 capsules on one side and 6 capsules if you flip it over. I flipped it to the 6 side hoping that this and the obvious presence a mans and womans clothing items would clearly indicate that there 2 people occupying the room ... Nope. The box was flipped back over and dutifully topped up for 1 person.Otherwise, the location is wonderful with a clear view of the harbour.

However, without any verbal complaints, the hotel took the initiative to gave us 1 more extra room to make up for the delay, which I feel that it is a very nice gesture and recovery on their part. The hotel has very exquisite classy designs, with a pool side view which makes it even more spectacular! If the hotel had more facilities, I believe this hotel would have easily soared above 5stars. One thing though, the food at the restaurant located at level4, has alot of great deals such as the lunch combo, just $12 could get you a full appetiser, main and a drink. Sadly to say, it is not the price that matters, but food quality that matters to us. Waiting time was alright even though there was only 1 server working.

Nice touch again. I was asked what time to send in the cake but when I checked in, the cake is already in the fridge. I wonder why they ask in the first place. Also waited for their call to check in, they only called once when I missed their call, and didnt make a 2nd call until I call back. Anyway, its small matters.\n\nI also asked for special pillows since they have a pillow menu but the pillow never came. Called the concierge again, the line was busy.There was a few heavy knocks at the rooms door way past midnight when I was already falling asleep. Didnt get up to open so I was wondering if they could be sending the pillows at that time?! I called at 10+pm and it took so long to get back and way past sleeping time. The coffee capsules that I asked earlier for turn out just sachets of instant coffee. They send the coffee but not the pillows\n\nJust felt the services somewhat uneven and kind of insincere.

They tried to scan their card on my door (lucky I locked it) and then I was woke up annoyed and they started ringing my doorbell and knocking on the connecting door from room 205. If no one was there or an empty room, do you think someone would open the door for you at 113am? And wouldnt it makes more sense to actually go to the reception and ask about the room? I opened the door and asked whats the issue? And then they just apologised. I called reception that never seems to pick up the call and finally did and promised to reprimand them. I doubt so.

Kam Leng is fine to store your things, has good wi-fi, and is generally OK if you are a solo traveller looking to save money and are not too picky about your accommodation. Thats all fine for me, but it feels like Kam Leng is in desperate need of renovations expecially in the bedrooms. The hotel is starting to show its age: the carpeting feel like its been ages since it was last deep vacuumed, the rust on the bathroom fittings is gross, and each room has a deep musky dank smell upon entering. Only after a few minutes of AC does the smell go away. Overall: an OK option if you are trying to cut costs, generally OK and clean, but I hope that the ownership spends some money to renovate and refurbish the rooms soon.
