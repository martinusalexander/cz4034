Besides that, age is showing within the interior and fixtures, e.g the curtain hook came loose on certain parts. It could be due to water saving measures, but the spray type faucet in the restroom sink is a little annoying since it splashes water all over. We tried to swim by the beach villa pools which was pretty unoccupied, however beware of invisible mozzie attacks by the lounge areas!! Definitely left us both with bad swellings! The management should try to fog the surrounding areas to ensure a more relaxing time as we couldnt even lounge longer than 10mins before getting bitten all over!

Had already Informed management but all they say is they improve next time only. They should have call or Ring the bell first. When I questioned them why come in, they just say see if need to TOP up anything at 7plus evening when no one requested. Which they can do so in the morning. 

After all this experience really teach me a lesson. Dont think thing for granted just becoz is a 6 star hotel. Maybe 4 star hotel is better than 6 star hotel

There was no shelter to go back to the hotel and there were no staff around the area. I made a call to resort world hotel line and asked if we could have a ride back by hotel buggy and they agreed to send. When the buggy arrived, the hotel staff says that it is for villa guest and drove off. Leaving us trapped at the shelter feeding the mosquitoes there. I was outraged and went to stopped the staff and asked him why not as the reception had agreed to send for the ride.

An breakfast charged was erroneously posted on my room charges and despite having clarified that it was a mistake and having repeatedly assured that my card would not be debited, I still received a displeasing surprise in the form of an unauthorised charge made without prior consent or knowledge. Subsequent attempts at communicating and resolving this issue amicably was hampered by an appalling lack of responsibility and lackadaisical demeanour from their customer service team. It was only after making a direct complaint to RWS resort wide feedback team, did I finally receive a call back (more than 24hrs later) from one of their duty managers who promptly proceeded to resolve this matter with commendable haste. Nonetheless, barring this incident, the overall experience was still outstanding. I do hope that the management team at hotel equarius will investigate and ensure that a repeat of such an unpleasant experience be prevented in the future. Cheers ",General

The fridge was dirty, the cupboard creaked and the door could have come off anytime. 

Theres no food place you can walk. Its just an isolated hotel. Sure its ok if you want to take a bus to Vivo or Chinatown, but thats a trip in itself.

We had an overnight on our way home and this hotel was three times the cost of anything else we stayed in including a previous trip to Singapore.I thought I would splurge since we had just one night. The window in the room was so dirty you could hardly see out of it it. The room was smallish and devoid of personality.The shuttle only goes every hour and a halfand it left five minutes early so we had to either wait an hour and a half or take a cab. We took a cab. We also had to take a cab the next morning or get up at 5:30 to get a shuttle that got us there 2 hours earlier than necessary. So factor that into your cost .If I was paying $40 a night I wouldnt be complaining. 
 The hotel is 10 minutes further from the airport then is advertised. However the location is very nice. Its near the ocean and theres a park and walking trails and a food court nearby.So if spending $100 + with no breakfast, and iffy shuttle is not a problem for you the location might make it worthwhile. Also they have a very nice pool.We werent there long enough to use it but it looked lovely.

We arrived for check in at 1am - concierge staff were very friendly and was a quick and easy check in - our paperwork was on the desk ready for our arrival. 

My mum had a fall in the rain up the road the next morning and we went to the desk for assistance - they were very attentive and brought ice and bag to make an ice pack to our room very quickly. 

The room itself is quite basic, but still has everything you need for a short stay - and this was more than I was expecting. Bathroom is spacious and clean, beds are SUPER comfy (more comfortable than the 5 star hotel we moved to for the rest of our 4 day trip!). It truly was the best sleep Ive had in a long time. 

Only downfall was the noise. We could hear the neighbours and people in the hallway more so than weve experienced in other hotels. 

Theres a fantastic hawker market open til 2am next door and another called Changi Village Hawker Centre across the road. It was great to be able to walk out at 1am and get dinner at that hour.

Location was far, and front counter staff was not exactly friendly. Nonetheless Im pretty easy going and did not kick up a fuss. The hotel room aircon is not very cold as well, and takes very long to cool down the room. At times we started perspiring in fact, and took a shower.

However, there was a little problem we only noticed after we reached our home. What i ordered and paid is for a Deluxe room with Sea View, but our room was facing the courtyard. So i dont really get what ive paid for.

Since we had a good time. Whatever.......

Decided to take up the Courtyard Suite as the highlight was a Private Jacuzzi Pool. However when we decide to go for a night swim with kids, the lights was faulty, thus it really dampen the mood, and we didnt really got thr chance to fully enjoy the room facilities at all.

Lastly, just when we wish to have a good night rest, the air-conditioner unit was unable to adjust its temperature. It was at 19 degree during the whole night, and we were shivering, waking up and never had a good rest.

Not the Amara service I was expecting.","Facilities & Services"
398,"Bad Experience","We arrived at the hotel lobby with no staff to help with unloading. me and my husband unloaded all the stuff ourselves. there were only two staff around at check in. The staff who attended to me, I only remembered him telling me, only tomorrow we will know if we can check out later than 12 noon. I think most of us are aware about the late check out procedures but I only needed him to put the request up so that the next staff that serves me would know I had requested for late check out in advance. We were then sent to our room, but Realized they had given us the wrong room. Because of theconfusing info on agoda(pictures with the living area,which the couple suite does not have)I thought I had paid for the family suite, but was given the Couple suite . Luckily, the family suite was available and they shifted us up. I requested extra pillows and towels, it took forever to send. and the reception was forever not picking up. Quite a disappointment with the standard and service of Amara.","Facilities & Services"
399,Disappointing,"Its sad that a place with such potential can be so disappointing.

My partner had pre-booked a cake with the staff beforehand to give me a surprise for my birthday. She specifically stipulated that this was not to be mentioned at check-in (so as not to ruin the surprise). Yet, at check-in, I was asked what time should the cake be brought in. Obviously, there was no more surprise. They offered late check out, which could only be confirmed later on in the day.

Birthdays/anniversaries and special dates only come along once in a while. If they cannot do this simple thing right, I think the quality of service (or lack thereof) speaks for itself. 

That aside, I appreciate the interior design of the Premier room, and the view and daybed by the window. However, my partner and I were sneezing during our stay as the place was a little dusty. Our noses were fine after checking out the following afternoon. 

I think this has great potential to be a sanctuary resort at such a prime location. But to the service staff and especially the management - you have your work cut out for you to achieve that.

Thedream pool looks like a beautiful place to relax and retreat to, hidden amidst lush greenery. There is also a sky pool, which overlooks the coast, and is more popular.

There is always kacang puteh, which are light snacks, and drinks at the lobby. The beach is 5 mins away, and there is a free bird show and kids play area there. 

Staff at Shutters were extremely helpful and friendly. Gave the children free juice and helped a lady who was fainting.A staff from housekeeping was very concerned when my child fell. He carried him and asked for ice immediately. Another staff also carried my child to the lobby.

They kept calling the room and disturbing my sleep to try and get us to give up the room when I already clearly told them I was going to pay for the extension. Eventually they persuaded us by saying well waive off the past few hours if we check out right now.And so we did, went to the front counter, and their staff DENIED making us the deal and wanted us to pay the $60 for 4 hours of extension.

492,"Not as good as expected","Last time I was at this hotel, it was around 15 years ago when traveling with my parents in my early teens. I was very excited when booking this hotel again in Feb 2017. 

Before booking my stay, I contacted the hotel reservation desk to make sure I could get an early check-in since I knew my flight from Melbourne - Singapore was arriving early. The email received was the generic response which you get from all hotels: It will depend on availability but we will endeavor checking you into your room as soon as possible. I was happy with the response since this is how hotels operate and you cant blame them for that. 

I arrived at the hotel at around 8am, tired after a long flight. The staff at the counter was very cold, couldnt check me in early, I was told to come back around 10am and advised that I could sit in the lounge and wait. I asked for a bottle of water and if there was a shower I could use to freshen up, she replied in a very rude way: Go to the swimming pool upstairs and ask for the staff, he will show you. Left my luggage at the reception and went to the swimming pool.

I asked for a towel and the location of the shower to the pool staff, he didnt even reply, just pointed to the towel rack and when I asked for the shower again, he just pointed with his finger while sending a txt msg using his mobile phone. 

I tried to relax until 10am and went back to the check-in counter. Another staff then advised that my room wasnt ready and to come back at 12pm. Came back at 12pm after a short walk on Orchard road. There was another staff at the counter, I was advised that check-in was at 2pm. The other staff didnt even pass the message to his colleague. I waited in the lounge, exhausted and very irritated. After an hour (1pm) I went back to the reception,there was a big line of people, another staff was then letting other guest check in early. By the time I was at the front another staff told me that check-in was 2pm. This time I cracked it, was furious and","Facilities & Services"

1. Breakfast is limited considering its cost. Replenishment is also limited and at certain times, no longer made despite the fact that breakfast time is still ongoing (supposed to ends at 10:30 am). Worst, they start cleaning the buffet table even if its not yet 10:30 which is disappointing to those having late breakfast. 
2. Just wondering why most cleaning staff, including the one in the breakfast restaurant, are cleaning so fast giving me the impression that they are in a hurry to go home. It makes me think whether the rooms were indeed cleaned well.

Did not extend courtesy to understand guests request and only regurgitated hotels position. 2) There were 2 staff at entrance and none offered to assist with luggage. 3) Paid more for Premier room but were old, while the cheaper Deluxe rooms were the renovated ones.4) Breakfast was not worth paying for, and it was the issue at check-in since the restaurant is not part of the hotel and there is a price difference in the room rate for single vs double occupancy. Unlike other hotels with their own FB outlets that do not have a price difference. 5) During checkout, had the bad timing of a fire alarm trigger that delayed the porter as the lifts were stopped for 40 minutes. 6) The only positive from the stay is the Manager who listened intently and took action to re-train the front desk staff.

Ms Norlelaanother lady receptionist, whom I didnt get the name, were also pleasant. Many of the business class hotels I have stayed in Singapore have much to learn about service culture from these staff!
